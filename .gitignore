# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# (optional) local gems, installed with
# bundle install --path vendor/bundle
# also a checkout of bundler for manpages and releases
# /vendor

# Ignore bundler config
.bundle

# Ignore Sass' cache
.sass-cache

# Ignore config.rb created by LiveReload+Subl in every folder
# except the one in the root, that has to be tracked
config.rb
!/config.rb

# Ignore the build directory
/build

.DS_Store
.svn/
